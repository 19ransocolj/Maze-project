# Maze-project
C++ swat final project/
This program is very simple to explain: the basic idea is you find yourself in a maze and are wanting out. The way this works is that you can only see objects around you and have to take action by typing the direction you wish to go.(This game is basically a simple version of a text adventure.) The maze is filled with walls, hallways and holes. The point is to get out of the maze without dying; you die, GAME OVER, also the game will give you grief.
The source code uses strings to display text and a array to hold cordinates of the maze layout. This program also uses a label.

To use this program just run the cpp file and you are good to go.
